# Linear Regression from Scratch & Scikit-Learn

This project demonstrates my **end-to-end implementation of Linear Regression**, both **from scratch using Python and NumPy** and using **Scikit-Learn**, trained on a **placements dataset**.  

The scratch implementation covers **manual calculation of parameters, gradient computation, and iterative updates**, giving a deep understanding of the core algorithm. The Scikit-Learn version allows for **quick training, evaluation, and comparison**.  

Key Highlights:  
- Built Linear Regression **without any ML libraries** to understand the underlying mathematics.  
- Compared results with **Scikit-Learn’s implementation** to verify correctness.  
- Evaluated model performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² score**.  
- Visualized predictions, regression lines, and residuals for insights.  
- Applied **data preprocessing and feature analysis** for the placements dataset.  

This project reflects my **hands-on understanding of machine learning, Python programming, and practical data science skills**, demonstrating the ability to implement and validate models from the ground up.
